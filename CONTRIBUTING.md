## Contributing
All contributions must be held to a certain standard of quality, mainly keeping the original code style in check.
1. Tab formatting
2. Unless its a return, please do not use 1 line for most function calls.
3. Localize variables when possible, most of the time the code should never have to index a variable, or call a function twice in a loop.

Here is the provided [documentation](https://github.com/7GrandDadPGN/VapeV4ForRoblox/wiki) for if you want to contribute.
